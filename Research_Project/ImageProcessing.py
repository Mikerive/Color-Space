'''
Preprocessing - Isolate power lines from the image
RGB Contrast Stretch
RGB - filter out areas of the image that have a high ratio of green, red, or blue.
Areas that have a high ratio of green vs blue are likely the ground.
The sky can either be blue or red and thus often tints the powerlines. This means that filtering out red and blue is often situational. This can change depending on the time that the image was taken.
Inversion - done regardless of the day for powerlines.
Power Lines and Power towers are darker than their surroundings in most images.
Apply gamma correction (2)
Gamma correction (2) suppresses the differences between features that have a lower value and enhances the difference between features with a higher value. This is desirable.
Grayscale - improves computational efficiency during segmentation. Once the color filtering is done, convert to grayscale.
Morphological closing operation 3x3
Used to make edges better stand out. Power lines are thin and often donâ€™t have enough difference between the background and the power lines to stand out.
Calculate Edge Direction map using fourier edge map.
