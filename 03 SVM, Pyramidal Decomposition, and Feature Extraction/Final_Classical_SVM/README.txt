This is the final project for image processing. I use classical image processing techniques to attempt to acheive the objective of our semester long goal. My goal was to identify powerlines in a cluttered and non-ideal image using a combination of classical preprocessing and a support vector machine.

The final classification accuracy was 65 percent. I believe this is impressive due to the nature of the images used in training and for testing. They were drone shots of powerlines of varying shapes with messy backgrounds, often filled with grass, trees, buildings, and roads. Perhaps with cleaner training and testing images, the classification accuracy would be far greater.

I also believe that the use of better segmentation techniques would result in greater classification accuracy.
