This is the final project for image processing. I use classical image processing techniques to attempt to acheive the objective of our semester long goal. My goal was to identify powerlines in a cluttered and non-ideal image using a combination of classical preprocessing and a support vector machine.

Due to the difficulty of this task, the final accuracy was only able to reach 65 percent. Perhaps with more research and different techniques, this task will be doable.
