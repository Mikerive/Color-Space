Image Lab is a compilation of the functions in the first two sections of the exploration. Due to the limitations of the python language, all implementations were critically slower than libraries like cv2. However, there is a greater amount of customization in some of these classes and functions. The work in image lab is a good template for custom work later - perhaps in a language other than C++.
