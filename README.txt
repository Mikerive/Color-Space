Image Lab was an early attempt to compile the functions and classes of the early half of the class. Due to the limitations of the python language, all implementations were critically slower than libraries like cv2. However, there is a greater amount of customization in some of these classes and functions. The work in image lab is a good template for custom work later - perhaps in a language other than C++.

The Research Project folder includes work associated with research presentation - an attempt to use hough lines and contour mapping to better understand the image.

Image Pyramids with Applications includes initial work with pyramidal decomposition as well as the SVM. Preprocessor includes the functions that were tested for adding to the SVM. Not all were used - some required further work and exploration.

Feature extraction includes the feature extraction assignment.

HOG and Explorations includes the HOG assigment.
