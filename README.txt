This repo is a compendium of the techniques implemented in image processing.

Section 1 involves the foundations of image arithmetic and processing concepts.
Section 2 involves classical edge detection and image segementation techniques.
Section 3 involves the final project, creating custom features for an SVM, and exploiting pyramidal decomposition to better deal with variance in scale of targets in the images.

There is also the code for a research presentation. This code was an exploration into stacking segmentation techniques in order to track contiguous lines in images. Though interesting, it wasn't particularly effective. Perhaps it can be improved with more tuning and techniques.
